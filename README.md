# Employee-Report-Power-BI--Dashboard-

Happy to share My first dashboard using #powerbi
Super Easy Tool , i can say that it is a cupcake of data analysis tools
But before using Power BI we should thinking first about data and ask ourselves the following questions :

* what the story behind the data ?
* what are the questions we would like to answer ?
* what really should be highlighted in our reports ?
* what are the relations we need to discover ?

keep in mind " the tool is never think" ,so as well as you need to know how you will use this tool to build outstanding a dashboards you should use your brain first to analyze data
